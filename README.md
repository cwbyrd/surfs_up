# surfs_up
Using SQLlite and Jupyter Notebook for Python to analyze weather data for the surfing business
## The first part of the project was to obtain data to determine whether or not the temperature was conducive to starting a surfing business. After completing the initial analysis, the results seemed satisfactory. However because the primary investor had gotten burned in a prior venture involving surf boards, the investor wanted specific temperure data for the months of June and December. 

### June Data 
To obtain June data, we did queries via SQLite and SQLAlchemy. We set up a query to obtain date and temperature data for June of all years in the data. The results are as captured in the below link.

### December Data
Similar to June, we queried date and corresponding temperature data from SQL for the months of December for all years in represented by the data. See below for the link to stats for the December temperatures.
